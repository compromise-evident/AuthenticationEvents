Assigned value: software change authorization for the following cryptographic tools:

Authorship      - infinite authentication tool.
AuthorshipFemto - infinite authentication everywhere.
Allornothing    - decrypt a file if all key carriers are present.
Multiway        - file encryption without reversal shortcuts.
OTP             - fast & plentiful One-time pad.
groupOTP        - fast & plentiful One-time pad for groups of any size.
schemeOTP       - fast One-time pad for all files up to 1MB.

As of today these tools are what I intended. And as they change, you may request the
modification of the first number as many times as you need, and demand that a sha256
hash of the new tool version is included as an Authorship message for each event.
   If I cannot provide the 613kB public file for each authentication event, then the
tool versions are not what I intended and may contain backdoors. These tools are NOT
restricted. They are yours to the fullest and most obnoxious extent of anarchy. Here
they exist as I intended. Ideas are welcome but the C++ is up to me, and me alone.
These Authorship numbers can prove that any additional works are what I intended.
